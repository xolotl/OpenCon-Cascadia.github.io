Nick Shockey is the Director of Programs & Engagement at SPARC where he focuses on fostering and supporting communities that 
advance Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data. In this capacity, Nick founded the Right to Research Coalition, an international 
alliance of student organizations—collectively representing millions of students in over 100 countries around the world—that promote 
policies and practices that make open the default for research. In 2014, Nick led the launch OpenCon, a conference and community that 
works to identify, cultivate, and empower leaders within the next generation to advance openness in research and education. To date, 
OpenCon has reached more than 8,000 in-person participants across 40 countries and catalyzed dozens of new projects, organizations, 
and campaigns. Nick is also particularly passionate about working with libraries to support their institutions in adopting open practices 
for research and education.
