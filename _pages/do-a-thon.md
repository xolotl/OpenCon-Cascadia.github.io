## What is a Do-a-Thon?

A do-a-thon is a short sprint where people from different perspectives and skill sets work together and collaborate on challenges, projects, or to learn something new. For OpenCon Cascadia’s do-a-thon, we’ll be focusing on activities that seek to make research and scholarship more open, inclusive, and accessible.

## Our Do-a-Thon has three key goals:

**1. Focus on doing.**
The do-a-thon's focus is on action. You don't need to be an expert to propose an activity or participate. Use this time to work on a new idea, find collaborators, teach or attend a workshop — you decide! Get creative with the approaches you take to create a more open system for sharing the world's information.

**2. Explore problems thoughtfully.**
We're asking participants to think about the hurdles and perspectives that contextualize an issue before jumping to a solution.

**3. Encourage collaboration across skill sets. Build and learn together.**
Amazing things can happen when people with a wide variety of skills and experience come together. We want policy makers to talk to educators, librarians to work with web developers, designers to collaborate with researchers, and everything in between. We're excited to see what happens when folks across disciplines pool together their knowledge to imagine something big.
## How can I participate?

The official do-a-thon date is on February 2nd, but we're encouraging folks to get started before — and hopefully, carry on projects and collaboration after. Here are a few ways you can get involved and participate:

**Anyone can propose something to work on.**
Is there a question or challenge you want to tackle? Do you want to teach something or learn? Here's a chance to share it with the community and work together. Participants can submit proposals the day of the do-a-thon, but we'd love if folks could submit ideas in advance, too.

**Anyone can propose a project for others to collaborate on and contribute to.**
Have a project idea you want to put into action? Or an existing project that needs development or support? The do-a-thon is a great opportunity to receive support and contributions from collaborators in the Pacific Northwest.

**Anyone can contribute their skills and ideas to existing ideas and projects.**
Participate by contributing to one or more of the do-a-thon proposals submitted. We expect that most of the action will take place on February 2nd, but feel free to get in touch with project leads and see how you can help out beforehand! You’ll be able explore OpenCon Cascadia projects and idea in advance of and at the conference.
