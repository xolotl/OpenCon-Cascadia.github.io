Lucille Moore recently joined the Department of Neurology at Oregon Health & Science University as a Postdoctoral Scholar and ORCCAMIND Fellow. Her research will explore the potential for mindfulness-based intervention (Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy or MBCT adapted for pregnant women) to alter developing fetal brain systems via reduced stress and inflammation in the mother. Outside of research, Lucille is passionate about creating a more equitable scientific and global community and deconstructing power dynamics created by ownership of information. To this end, Lucille works as an open science advocate to promote open practices at her institution. She also works as a founding member of the Alliance for Visible Diversity in Science to promote recruitment, retention, and support of graduate students from historically underrepresented backgrounds in academia.
