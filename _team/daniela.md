Daniela is neuroscience Ph.D. Candidate and community organizer passionate about bringing open practices into the world of academia as a means to improve reproducibility and collaboration. Her Ph.D. research combines _in vivo_ electrophysiology, behavior, and computational modeling to understand how sound is processed in the dynamic brain. Daniela is also a [Mozilla Fellow for Science 2018-2019](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/08/21/mozilla-announces-25-new-fellows-in-openness-science-and-tech-policy/). During her fellowship, she will be working on a project she co-founded in September 2017 called [PREreview](https://www.prereview.org), an open platform and community to facilitate the collaborative writing of preprint reviews and the training of early-career researchers in scientific peer review. Through this work, she hopes to foster a broader and much needed cultural change in the way science is evaluated and disseminated.
